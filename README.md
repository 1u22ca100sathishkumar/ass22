1. Different Software Development Models

A software development model (also called SDLC model) defines the process used to plan, design, develop, test, and maintain software.

Common Software Models:

Waterfall Model

Linear and sequential approach

Each phase must be completed before moving to the next

Phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Maintenance

Best for small projects with clear requirements

V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)

Extension of the Waterfall model

Testing is planned in parallel with development

Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase

Iterative Model

Software is developed in small iterations

Each iteration adds new functionality

Allows early feedback and improvements

Incremental Model

System is developed in increments (modules)

Each increment is a working product

Easier to manage risks

Spiral Model

Combines iterative development with risk analysis

Each loop of the spiral includes planning, risk analysis, development, and evaluation

Suitable for large and complex projects

Prototype Model

A prototype is built to understand user requirements

Helps clarify unclear requirements

Reduces requirement-related risks

RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model

Focuses on quick development using reusable components

High user involvement

Suitable for time-critical applications

Agile Model

Iterative and incremental development

Focuses on flexibility, customer collaboration, and continuous delivery

2. What is Agile? Explain Different Agile Frameworks
What is Agile?

Agile is a software development approach that emphasizes:

Customer collaboration

Flexibility to change

Continuous delivery of working software

Small, self-organizing teams

Agile is based on the Agile Manifesto, which values:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

Agile Frameworks:

Scrum

Most popular Agile framework

Work is divided into Sprints (2–4 weeks)

Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team

Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

Kanban

Visual workflow management using Kanban boards

Focuses on continuous delivery

Limits work in progress (WIP)

No fixed iterations

Extreme Programming (XP)

Focuses on high-quality code and technical excellence

Practices include pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration

Lean Software Development

Inspired by Lean manufacturing

Focuses on eliminating waste and improving efficiency

Delivers value quickly to customers

SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

Used for large organizations

Scales Agile practices across multiple teams

Combines Agile, Lean, and DevOps principles

Crystal

Family of Agile methodologies

Focuses on people, communication, and skills

Lightweight and flexible

Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

Focuses on designing and building features

Suitable for larger teams

Emphasizes domain modeling
